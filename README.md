# Take-aways:
### 1. React Components: 
- Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return JSX.

- We write JSX inside a component, which looks exactly like HTML.
  - "class" in JSX is not allowed like we use in HTML, instead, use "className".
  - Whenever we need to use a variable, we need to use it in curly braces.

### 2. Props i.e Properties:
- We use props to pass on information from one component to another component.

- Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
  - React Props are function arguments in JS.

### 3. State:
- **State** in react is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

- A component's state can change over time, since data and information can change; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

  - **Hooks** allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
